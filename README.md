# libraryCatalog
 A catalog program that allows a user to update and view a catalog of books.

 This personal project was completed in March 2023. It uses a linked list to maintain data while running,
 and backs up/loads data from a text file.

 The future will bring better commands, the rest of my books, and more sophisticated file storage :)
 To run, download the repository as a .zip and extract, navigate to the folder through command line, and run "make".
 Then run the executable!
